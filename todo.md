# Todo
[ ] TODO - figure out why react server sometimes throws a 524 Gateway Error when launching all 3 servers


# Not sure if doing
[?] TODO - "Index" based approach in react modules is maybe not necessary anymore


# Done
[x] TODO - script.js is double-loaded (by theme & by vite) in dev mode, causing all listeners to be t twice
[x]Â TODO - in dev mode, theme's script.js, style.css and bundles must be empty or deleted, because vite is serving them (needed for HMR)


# Scrapped
[x] TODO - HMR for edits to js-modules /// Not happening - vite is not designed to do that.
